          Dear family and friends,
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of a normal wedding registry, we've decided
          to do something a bit different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout our lives, we want to stay
          connected with you. It can get expensive
          traveling back and forth between California and exotic, remote
          locations like North Dakota. So, instead of traditional wedding
          presents, we are asking for contributions to our
          <em>Family and Friends Travel Fund</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
          <br/>
          Nina and Cam
        </p>
